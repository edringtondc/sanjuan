Your 30 minute visit could look like - history, analysis, stretching, analysis, grounding, adjusting, analysis, facilitating the energy flow from top to bottom, extremities if needed, analysis - then walking around utilizing specific stretches to note change from the treatment. Expect 2-4 visits when presenting as a new patient.  Typically you will leave after one treatment feeling great and holding the treatment for many weeks to months.",
